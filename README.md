## üß† Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Transformers have revolutionized NLP and computer vision. The **Siglip Vision Transformer** (ViT) extends the transformer architecture to vision tasks, effectively modeling long-range dependencies in images. ViT processes images by splitting them into smaller patches, embedding them, and using multi-headed attention to learn spatial dependencies, achieving state-of-the-art results on various vision tasks.

> **Why Transformers for Vision?**
> - Traditional CNNs process local spatial relationships but struggle with long-range dependencies.
> - Transformers capture both local and global dependencies efficiently through attention mechanisms.

In this repository, you‚Äôll find a PyTorch implementation of a Vision Transformer model, including patch embedding, multi-headed self-attention, and an encoder structure.

## üèó Architecture Overview <a name="architecture-overview"></a>

Here's a visual overview of the Vision Transformer architecture:

*Image source: [ViT Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15343)*

### Architecture Components:

1. **Patch Embedding**:
   - An image is split into fixed-size patches.
   - Each patch is projected into a vector using a linear transformation.

2. **Position Embeddings**:
   - To retain the positional information, learnable positional embeddings are added to the patch embeddings.

3. **Multi-Headed Self-Attention (MHSA)**:
   - The core of the transformer architecture.
   - Computes the relationships between patches using self-attention mechanisms.

4. **Feedforward Neural Network (FFN)**:
   - Applies transformations to the attention outputs, consisting of two linear layers with a GELU activation.

5. **Layer Normalization**:
   - Normalizes the outputs of the MHSA and FFN layers for stability.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Code Structure <a name="code-structure"></a>

The code is organized into several classes, each representing a specific component of the Vision Transformer:

- **`SiglipVisionConfig`**: Configuration class that sets up hyperparameters like `hidden_size`, `num_layers`, etc.
- **`SiglipVisionEmbeddings`**: Handles patch embedding and positional encoding.
- **`SiglipAttention`**: Implements multi-headed self-attention.
- **`SiglipMLP`**: The feedforward neural network component.
- **`SiglipEncoderLayer`**: Combines attention and MLP components in a transformer block.
- **`SiglipEncoder`**: Stacks multiple encoder layers.
- **`SiglipVisionTransformer`**: Integrates embeddings and encoder.
- **`SiglipVisionModel`**: The main model class that pulls everything together.

The detailed implementation of each class is as follows:

```python
# Example implementation of the SiglipAttention class
class SiglipAttention(nn.Module):
    """Multi-headed attention from 'Attention Is All You Need' paper"""
    ...
```

For more details, explore the code files or read through the documentation of each class.

## üíª Usage <a name="usage"></a>

### 1. **Installation**:
First, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/siglip-vision-transformer.git
cd siglip-vision-transformer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. **Instantiate the Model**:
Here's how to set up and use the model:

```python
import torch
from siglip_vision_model import SiglipVisionModel, SiglipVisionConfig

# Create a configuration
config = SiglipVisionConfig(
    hidden_size=768,
    intermediate_size=3072,
    num_hidden_layers=12,
    num_attention_heads=12,
    image_size=224,
    patch_size=16,
    num_channels=3
)

# Initialize the model
model = SiglipVisionModel(config)

# Dummy input tensor [Batch_Size, Channels, Height, Width]
dummy_image = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)

# Forward pass
output = model(dummy_image)
print(output.shape)  # [1, num_patches, hidden_size]
```

### 3. **Training the Model**:
Integrate the Siglip Vision Transformer in your training pipeline with loss functions and optimizers of your choice. You can fine-tune it for tasks like image classification, object detection, etc.

## üéØ Training the Model <a name="training-the-model"></a>

To train the Siglip Vision Transformer:

1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - Choose a dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet).
   - Preprocess images into the required shape (e.g., 224x224).

2. **Training Loop**:
   - Utilize a loss function like cross-entropy.
   - Use optimizers such as AdamW for stability.

```python
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.nn import CrossEntropyLoss

criterion = CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=3e-4)

# Example training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for images, labels in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(images)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

### Evaluation and Fine-tuning
Fine-tune the model on different datasets or tasks using transfer learning techniques.

## üìä Visual Explanations <a name="visual-explanations"></a>

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step breakdown of how images are processed in the Siglip Vision Transformer:

1. **Image Patching**:
   - The image is divided into smaller patches (e.g., 16x16).
   - Each patch is then flattened and projected into a high-dimensional vector.

2. **Self-Attention Computation**:
   - The multi-headed self-attention computes relationships between patches.

3. **Output Embeddings**:
   - The transformer layers output contextualized patch embeddings, which can be used for downstream tasks like classification.
